# Landing Page Project
This is the first project I have done using JavaScript
------------------------------------------------
in HTML
--------
I made some changes and additions to the index file (HTML page)
I changed section titles and contents
I added a new section same as the existing 
I also added another new section that allows entering cusom paragraph data according to the user's need, title and content
And I added a button in the header of the page to navigate  to add section.
--------------
In script file
--------------
I added global and private variables
And functions to perform an automatic task of the contents of the horizontal list
As well as for each cusom section that the user created, it appears in the same list
I also implemented an activation process for each section, to which it will be appear  automatically in the nav bar

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
